    Attributes:
      id       = Unique alphanumeric identifier for the datasource.
      type     = Type of the datasource (e.g. IStoreOnline, QueryDistributor, or Dicom). This type will be mapped to different adapters
                 when used in query, restore, etc. in their corresponding configuration files.
      distance = When a study resides on more than one datasource, the distance value is used to determine which datasource is used.
                 The datasource with the smallest distance value will be used (1 is the smallest distance value). All datasources
                 need to have different distance values (unless they are configured for remote servers, in which case distance uniqueness
                 is only needed per remote server).

    Common Parameters:
      name                                 = Name of the datasource.
      address                              = Location of the datasource.
      activeStatus                         = If the datasource is active. Active datasource can be directly queried on, while passive datasources
                                             can only be used indirectly, e.g. used by QueryDistributor, or XDS KOS referenced datasource.
      supportedQueryTypes                  = Supported query types on this datasource. Multiple types should be separated by "\,".
                                             Valid values include:
                            Radiology
                            Document
      patientIdDomains                     = Mapped patient ID domains. Multiple authority names should be separated by "\,".
                                             Configuration of patient ID domains is in ResourceConfiguration.xml.
      associatedDocumentDataSources = Document data sources that are associated with the radiology data source. When loading a study from
                                      study list, these document data sources will be queried to get the list of documents. If this parameter
                                      is missing, no document will be listed.
      dicom.storeSCP.host                  = The host name or IP address of this datasource when used as DICOM Store SCP (for GSPS/attachment saving, etc.).

      dicom.storeSCP.aeTitle               = The DICOM AETITLE of this datasource when used as DICOM Store SCP.
      otherIdentifiers                     = Other names/identifiers. E.g. retrieve AE title(s) or retrieve location UID used in KOS.
                                             Multiple AE titles should be separated by "\,".
      wado.baseUrl                         = The base URL of this datasource's WADO address. Currently these datasource types use WADO:
                                               Dicom, Amicas
      timeout                              = Time out when querying this datasource, in seconds.

    Dicom DataSource Parameters:
      dicom.queryType                      = The type of query that will be issued:
                                               relational - Non-negotiated relational query.
                                               hierarchical - Study root hierarchical query.
      dicom.queryRetrieveSCP.host          = The host name or IP address of this datasource when used as DICOM Query/Retrieve SCP.

      dicom.storeSCU.aeTitle               = The DICOM AETITLE of this datasource when used as DICOM Store SCU (e.g. as source node of image transfer).
      dicom.cFindSupport                   = If the DICOM server supports C-FIND. The datasource should be passive if C-FIND is not supported.
      dicom.instanceQuerySupport           = If the DICOM server supports instance query.
      dicom.listOfUidMatchingSupport       = If the DICOM server supports List of UID Matching.

                                             back to series level InstanceQuery. It is to prevent too many individual C-FIND requests to the server. This
                                             only taks effect if dicom.listOfUidMatchingSupport is false as UIDs can be combined to a list if supported.
      dicom.modalitiesInStudySupport       = If the DICOM server supports ModalitiesInStudy.
      dicom.performSeriesQueryForModality  = Performs a series level query to retrieve modality if ModalitiesInStudy is not supported.
      dicom.allowScuCaching                = If SCU caching is allowed on this datasource. If allowed, the same DICOM association will be reused without

      dicom.maxCachedConnections           = Maximum number of SCU that can be cached for later use.
      dicom.maxOpenConnections             = Maximum number of SCU that can be actively used concurrently.
      dicom.tls.ciphers                    = Only when TLS is used. List one or more cipher strings separated by colons. Commas or spaces are also acceptable 
                                             separators but colons are normally used. Each element can be (for more elements, see OpenSSL ciphers(1) man page):
                                               DEFAULT             - The default cipher list. This is determined at compile time and, as of OpenSSL 1.0.0, is
                                                                     normally ALL:!aNULL:!eNULL. This must be the first cipher string specified.

                                               EXP, EXPORT         - Export encryption algorithms. Including 40 and 56 bits algorithms. 
                                               EXPORT40            - 40 bit export encryption algorithms
                                               eNULL, NULL         - The "NULL" ciphers that is those offering no encryption. Because these offer no encryption
                                                                     at all and are a security risk they are disabled unless explicitly included. 
                                               aNULL               - The cipher suites offering no authentication. This is currently the anonymous DH algorithms.

                                               DES                 - Cipher suites using DES (not triple DES). 
                                               MD5                 - Cipher suites using MD5. 
                                               SHA1, SHA           - Cipher suites using SHA1.
      dicom.tls.caCertFile                 = Only when TLS is used. If caCertFile is not NULL, it points to a file of CA certificates in PEM format.
                                             The file can contain several CA certificates.
      dicom.tls.caCertPath                 = Only when TLS is used. If caCertPath is not NULL, it points to a directory containing CA certificates in PEM format.
                                             The files each contain one CA certificate. The files are looked up by the CA subject name hash value,
                                             which must hence be available. Certificates will be first searched in caCertFile then those in caCertPath.
                                             In server mode, when requesting a client certificate, the server must send the list of CAs of which it will
                                             accept client certificates. For further defailts, please see OpenSSL SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations(3) man page.
      dicom.tls.localCertPath              = Only when TLS is used. Local public key for the certificate to be used for peer authentication.
      dicom.tls.secKeyPath                 = Only when TLS is used. Keystore for holding private/public keys.
      dicom.tls.secKeyPass                 = Only when TLS is used. If the keystore location defined above is encrypted, the password for accessing it should be
                                             defined here.
      dicom.tls.authenticatePeer           = Only when TLS is used. Flag to control authentication between peers.
      wado.baseUrl                         = See common parameters.
      dicom.useImpatientMove               = When the DICOM server doesn't support instance query, it forces completion of a C-MOVE after the last C-STORE operation is received.
      excludedAttributes                   = Names of attributes which the dicom server doesn't support, use "\," to split them if it is multiple values.
      dicom.isUnicodeCharacterSetSupported = Denotes whether the datasource supports Unicode character set. When a new text annotation is added in an image
                                             and if the datasource supports Unicode character set, the Specific character set tag (0008,0005) is added in the
                                             dataset with the value as "ISO_IR 192". If the data source doesn't support Unicode character set tag, it is not
                                             included.
      dicom.includeMultiComponentPNSeparatorInCFind
                                           = In the case of Patient names with multiple component names, some data sources require the multi-component
                                             separator in the C FIND query to do a correct Patient name component comparison. In such cases, we need to
                                             include the "=" multi-component separator. If the data source doesn't support this, the query will not contain
                                             the "=" multi-component separator.

    Amicas DataSource Parameters:
      amicas.serverBaseUrl                 = The base URL of Amicas servlets. Usually it's the Amicas server's root HTTP/HTTPS path.
      amicas.authMethod                    = Authentication method used by Amicas server. Supported methods:
                                               Basic,
                                               Digest,
                                               Windows,
                                               None
                                             Usually Amicas server uses Basic authentication.
      amicas.userName                      = User name used in authentication. It is the same user as the one used to login to Amicas.
      amicas.password                      = Password used in authentication. It is the same password as the one used to login to Amicas.
      amicas.realm                         = Realm (or domain) for authentication. Used only in Digest authentication.
      amicas.alwaysUseOrigSOPInstanceUID   = Always use original SOP Instance UID. Amicas keeps a lossy compressed version of lossless images, and assign them different
                                             SOP Instance UIDs. Once lossless version is deleted, the lossy version will be loaded, and this setting can force it to
                                             use the origoinal SOP Instance UID instead of the assigned one. This would allow old PR/KO series to be loaded successfully.
      amicas.useSecuredVolumes             = Use secured volumes. Amicas' image volumes can be secured to prevent direct access to images. In this case we will have to
                                             provide security cookies for each image access, even for ".dcm" files. This might require re-login and would bring a
                                             performance impact.
      amicas.versionString                 = The version of the PACS. Used to determine how radiology and document queries are done.
      dicom.performSeriesQueryForModality  = See Dicom parameters.
      dicom.allowScuCaching                = See Dicom parameters.
      dicom.maxCachedConnections           = See Dicom parameters.
      dicom.maxOpenConnections             = See Dicom parameters.
      dicom.tls.ciphers                    = See Dicom parameters.
      dicom.tls.caCertFile                 = See Dicom parameters.
      dicom.tls.caCertPath                 = See Dicom parameters.
      dicom.tls.localCertPath              = See Dicom parameters.
      dicom.tls.secKeyPath                 = See Dicom parameters.
      dicom.tls.secKeyPass                 = See Dicom parameters.
      dicom.tls.authenticatePeer           = See Dicom parameters.
      wado.baseUrl                         = See common parameters.

    Fusion/Immedia DataSource Parameters:
      artemis.type                         = The type of Artemis data source. Currently only 2 Artemis types are recognized:
                                               Fusion
                                               Immedia
      artemis.port                         = The port # Artemis server is listening on. This is usually 10000.
      artemis.respondTo                    = The IP address used to communicate with Artemis server. This helps when WebAccess is running
                                             on a server with multiple NICs. The default IP of WebAccess might not be in the same network
                                             segment as Artemis server.
                                             If not configured, the default IPv4 address of WebAccess server will be used to communicate
                                             with Artemis server.
      artemis.mapPathFrom                  = Path mapping, "from" part. When querying Artemis server, we get locations of part10 files in
                                             that server's local path which is not accessible from WebAccess server. Path mapping resolves
                                             this problem by changing local path to a HTTP URL or a network UNC share.
                                             For example, a Fusion server configures local storage as C:\dicom\Storage, and expose this
                                             path as a virtual directory http://FusionServer/FusionStorage, we can then set up a path
                                             mapping from C:\dicom\Storage to http://FusionServer/FusionStorage.
      artemis.mapPathTo                    = Path mapping, "to" part.
      
    I-Store DataSource Parameters:
      mcIStore.queryDsn                    = The system DSN used to query I-Store server's MCASHVINS database.
      mcIStore.mapPathFrom                 = Similar to artemis.mapPathFrom. It is used to map I-Store server's image pool to a network
                                             accessible path. The only different is that I-Store supports multiple pools so this parameter
